# PCA v.s. VAE

---

> Abstract

     This is project that shows how PCA and Variational Auto Encoder works. I reconstructed pictures based on Olivetti Dataset with PCA and VAE. This pictures and ReadME file will show you how do pictures look when they are reconstructed with PCA, VAE. Also this file will explain how PCA and VAE works different. So if you want information about PCA and VAE, please read this file. 
     I know I didn't made my VAE model in proper way, since it is my first ML/DL project(which was made in my first internship term). So freely write  your opinion please.
